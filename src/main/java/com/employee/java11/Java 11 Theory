1 - One major change is that we donâ€™t need to compile the java source file with javac tool first.
    We can directly run the file with java command and it implicitly compiles.

2- String methods [ isBlank(), lines(), strip(), stripLeading(), stripTrailing(), repeat(int)]

isBlank()       = Returns a boolean value. Empty Strings and Strings with only white spaces are treated as blank.
lines()         = This method returns a stream of strings.
strip()         = Removes the white space from both, beginning and the end of string.
stripLeading()  = Removes the white space beginning of string.
stripTrailing() = Removes the white space end of string.
repeat(int)     = The repeat method simply repeats the string that many numbers of times.
