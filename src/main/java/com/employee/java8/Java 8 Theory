1-Lambda Expression?
 By the Lambda Expression we can represent an anonymous function
 Anonymous means  Name less / Unknown
 Anonymous function : Which method who don't have any name or modifier

 Syntax: Parameter     Expression       Body
            ()              ->          System.out.println("Aamir khan");

 The Interface who contain only one abstract method but can have multiple default & static method
 is called Functional Interface.

 Ex.
        Runnable   ->    run();
        Callable   ->    call();
        Comparable ->    compareTo();
        Comparator ->    compare();

2- Consumer Functional Interface?
    it is a functional interface which is introduce in java 8
    Consumer takes an object in input and produce a result
    consumer function don't return any value because accept method return type is void
    only one abstract method   void accept(T t);


3- Predicate Functional interface?
    it is a functional interface which is introduce in java 8
    Takes one arguments in input and return the boolean value
    only one abstract method  boolean test(T t);


4- Supplier Functional Interface?
    it is a functional interface which is introduce in java 8
    Takes no argument but output expected
    only one abstract method  T get();
