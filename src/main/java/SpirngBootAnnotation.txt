Question :- what is @SpringBootApplication annotation?
inside this annotation there is three annotations
1-@EnableAutoConfiguration
2-@ComponentScan
3-@Configuration

1-@EnableAutoConfiguration:-
@EnableAutoConfiguration enable the automatic configuration based on the jar dependency.
The dependency added inside the pom.xml

2-@ComponentScan:-
@ComponentScan will just scan the bean so that can it is visible to IOC container.

3-@Configuration:-
we use this annotation for java base configuration where we can define the bean definitions inside the class
so that spring ioc container load it.


Question :-  Stereotype annotation
@Component  : it is root annotation in spring boot
@Service
@RestController
@Controller
@Repository

We can use @Component on the place of @Service, @RestController, @Controller,  @Repository,
but we can not easily identify the role of classes

@Question : - Spring core annotations?
@Configuration
@Bean
@Autowired
@Qualifier
@Primary
@Lazy
@Value :-  when i want to use load some meta-data from the properties file then we can use this annotation.
@PropertySource
@ConfigurationProperties
@Profile
@Scope

@Configuration & @Bean :- When I want to use java base configuration. it means we don't want handle the
spring bean life cycle either using annotations or XML.
Both annotation indicates the class can be used by IOC container as a source of bean definitions.

@Lazy :- By default spring bean is eager loading, I mean if we define bean in our application then spring ioc
         create the object by default, however it does not matter whether that bean is using or not,
         which really increase the heap.

@PropertySource :- suppose that I have created a custom.properties files and want to read this file inside a particular
                   controller or business layer then use this annotation on that particular class
                   but, we have to tell the path like = @PropertySource("classpath:custom.properties")
                   Note :- if we are not using then got IllegalArgumentException


@Qualifier :- if we create two or multiple implementation classes of a single interface with all same overridden method
              then we will get the error like ( required a single bean, but multiple were found)
              for solving this issue we will have to use @Qualifier, or we can use @Primary

              @Autowired
              @Qualifier("employeeServiceImpl2")
              private EmployeeService employeeService;
